## ✅ Next Steps (Recommended)
I can:
1. Customize this README **exactly** to your project idea  
2. Add badges (AI, Hackathon, Python, Node)  
3. Rewrite it to score **maximum hackathon points**  
4. Add a **proper problem–solution narrative** for judges  

Just tell me:
👉 **What exactly does your project do in 1–2 lines?**
